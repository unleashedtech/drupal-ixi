Drupal InDesign XML Importer
============================

Configuration
-------------

The 'group' configuration options specify the content type and the fields that
should be created when uploading a new archive of XML files. Typically, this
is the 'volume' content type.

Note that the fields are generated as if they were in the new content form.
